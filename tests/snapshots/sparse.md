# Tiny Design System

## Do

- Use only the 1 tokens in `colors` — reference them by role, not by hex literal.
- Keep body text at or above a 4.5:1 contrast ratio against its background.
- Reuse the component values verbatim; they are measured from the live page, not approximated.

## Don't

- Do not invent colors, tints or shades that are not in this document.
- Do not introduce new fonts, weights or sizes outside the scale.
- Do not use arbitrary spacing values such as `13px` or `27px`.
- Do not copy layout or wording from the source site; this document describes style only.

## Agent instructions

- Use only the tokens defined in the frontmatter of this file.
- Never invent a color; if a shade is missing, reuse the closest listed token.
- Reproduce component values (padding, radius, border, shadow) verbatim from the Components section.
- Reproduce the documented motion timings and interaction states rather than defaults.
- Verify text/background contrast meets 4.5:1 before shipping any pairing not listed here.
- Generate original copy and layout — this document supplies visual style only.

## Interaction states

### Recommended (not observed)

The extraction measured only `:hover`. Treat these as defaults, not as facts about the source.

- **focus** — Render a visible focus ring on every interactive element — 2px, offset 2px, using `accent` or `border`.
- **active** — Apply a small positional shift or a darker fill; never remove the focus ring.
- **disabled** — Reduce opacity to ~0.5 and remove hover/active feedback entirely.
